## Where does plainjavarules fit in ? ##

  * Simple UI to create/manage rules
  * Easy to customizable , as entire implementation is in Java
  * Add new functionalities/override existing functionality
  * No commercial obligation
  * No DSL language used
  * Ability to administer and define custom DSL
  * Simple to configure and use ,hence can be handed over to business people to manage.


I wanted a simple rules engine which gives me all the flexibility to adapt , yet not complex  and UI to manage  , eventually hand it over to business to manage simple rules and not come back to developers for every small change in business logic , i couldnt find one , hence i created one.


Here is a list of rules engines evaluated before creating the **plainjavarules**

## Drools ##
Drools is from Jboss.

**Pros:**
  * Supports most features.
  * It is pretty Stable.
  * Decent forum support.

**Cons:**
  * Heavy weight
  * Adverse Performance impact for high volume
  * Subjective expertise needed in setting up this system, moreover its complicated & steep learning curve for Developers
  * only the runtime environment is provided by Drools, tools and repository are supported only by Drools Guvnor
> > Effectively we need to deploy two systems for providing use and manage rules.
  * Doesnâ€™t support strip down version GUI to only edit the drool rules on-the-fly ,need to install Guvnor (is the web application and repository to govern Drools and jBPM assets.)to manage rules
  * Only paid support
