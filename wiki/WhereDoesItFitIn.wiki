Here is a list of rules engines evaluated before creating the plainjavarules


==Drools==
Drools is from Jboss.

*Pros:*
 * Supports most features.
 * It is pretty Stable.
 * Decent forum support.

*Cons:*
 * Heavy weight
 * Adverse Performance impact for high volume
 * Subjective expertise needed in setting up this system, moreover its complicated & steep learning curve for Developers
 * only the runtime environment is provided by Drools, tools and repository are supported only by Drools Guvnor
   Effectively we need to deploy two systems for providing use and manage rules.                                               
 * Doesn’t support strip down version GUI to only edit the drool rules on-the-fly ,need to install Guvnor (is the web application and repository to govern Drools and jBPM assets.)to manage rules                                       
 * Only paid support
